# Greetings! Welcome to the Hacktober Fest!

If you are just beginning to code and are interested in Web Development (specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript),
then this is the project for you! There are a couple of issues that you can work on as a new contributer which are
relatively simple. If you need any help in learning how to use GitHub, feel free to reach out to me at redfireforever103@gmail.com. 

You are welcome to join if you are a more advanced project, however, keep in mind that this project was added mainly
for new developers to work on, and this specific project may not fully meet your skill needs. 

If you are absolutely new to HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, here are a couple of webpages that can help you learn the basics of web 
development. I personally enjoy W3School's tutorials, as they are very involved and easy to understand. They also offer other
tutorials if you would like to learn a different programming language! You are also free to use any other resources that will
help you with your Web Development Journey!

[W3Schools HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

[W3Schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)

[W3Schools JS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)

To make contributions to my project as seamlessly as possible, I recommend downloading the following products (I will walk through
how to use these products later):

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) This will help you make easy pull requests on my project.
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) This is one of my favorite code editing systems. It is very easy to use with Github Desktop, and I highly recommend it.

## 

First and foremost, if you do not currently have a GitHub account, please create one. The following link can help you navigate through creating your own GitHub account.

[Create Your GitHub Account](https://github.com/join)

To see what issues are currently available for you to work in, navigate to my main repository page and select **Issues**. For first-time users, I have labeled easy issues as **good first issues** to develop your web programming skills. For more experienced web developers, you may work on any issue, however, most of them are enhancements. If you find any bugs, feel free to add a new issue to the repository.

Once you find an issue that you would like to work on, click on the issue and navigate to the right side of your screen. Look for the **Assignees** option and click the settings gear next to it. Assign yourself to this issue so other people know that you are currently working on this issue.

## GitHub Desktop
After downloading and setting up GitHub Desktop (make sure you download the application for your system's specific OS, yours should automatically appear as the first option to download), you will want to clone a repository. 

When you are cloning a repository, you are making a copy of my code (hosted on GitHub) and storing it on your computer. What you will want to do is navigate to the top left corner of GitHub Desktop and click **current repository**. To clone my repository, navigate to the **Add** button and choose clone repository. After the pop-up window appears, navigate to URL and paste the following link: 
[goulet-coder/goulet-coder.github.io](goulet-coder/goulet-coder.github.io).

You can choose any local path that you would like, as long as you know where it is. 

After this, click **clone**. You now have a copy of my code installed on your local machine.

Next, you will want to **fetch origin** (top middle of the Github Desktop application), which updates all of my code to make sure that the code you downloaded is up to date with the current code in my repository.

After you have done this, select **choose branch** and then select **Add**. On the pop-up window, name the branch to reflect the issue you are currently working on. Since this is a small project which does not currently need a development branch, you can create the branch based off of the master branch. 

Next, you will want to publish your branch on GitHub, which will allow you to make commits and pull requests. Follow the GitHub Desktop directions for publishing your branch. 

Now, you are ready to begin your work on the issue. On GitHub Desktop, you can select **Open in Visual Studio Code** where you can view and edit the code.

## Visual Studio Code

If you are new to Visual Studio Code, I highly recommend enabling Intellisense, which will help you spot syntactical errors (such as spelling and proper commands). Once you click on the file, a pop-up should appear at the bottom right corner of your screen. Allow the changes to be made to Visual Studio code, and you should be all set!

Now you are free to begin your work on the issue! I highly recommend reading the tutorials if you are new to HTML/CSS/JavaScript or are unsure how to fix the issue.

## Publishing Your Changes

If you would like to save your changes on your local machine (and have those changes appear on your branch), you can send a commit, which is the Ctrl + Save feature of Git. GitHub Desktop will automatically show what changes you have made to the code, and you automatically have the option to commit your code. When making a commit, leave a short note on the current progress you have made on the issue, as well as anything you would like to remind yourself once you come back to working on the issue. 

First, make sure you push your commits to origin. When you make a commit on GitHub Desktop, you are only saving the code on your local computer. To see your changes reflected on your GitHub branch, you must push to origin, which puts your code on your branch on GitHub. 

Once you are done working on your issue and completing the steps above, you are ready to make your Pull Request! For those who are new to Git, a pull request will allow you to send a copy of your code (which should fix the issue you are currently working on) to me, in which I could choose to use as the new foundational code for my website (hosted on the master branch). First, just to ensure that you do not lose your progress, make one final commit on GitHub Desktop. Then, you should be able to see the **Create Pull Request** button. Click on this button to create your pull request. It should redirect you to the GitHub website.

This will give you one final option to review the changes you have made in the code. If everything looks good, leave a short comment explaining what you have done, and create your pull request! That is all you will need to do to get a point for your pull request quota (assuming you make meaningful changes to the code).

If you are interested in working on this project further, I will review your pull request (reach out to me if I do not respond to your pull request within 24 hours). Depending on how you fixed the issue, I will either accept your pull request (where your changes will be included in the master branch), or I will reject your pull request with a short explanation why, as well as offer some guidance on how to resolve this issue. 

Again, if you are encountering any issues, feel free to reach out to me at redfireforever103@gmail.com! 

## Code of Conduct

The code of conduct is relatively simple. 

First and foremost, please be kind and helpful to one another! Anyone from any coding background is welcome to work on this project! If you are an experienced developer, please leave good first issues to people who are new to programming.

If you see someone that has assigned themselves to an issue, please know that they are most likely working on this issue!

When you are creating your branch, you must create your branch based off of the master branch, as creating it off of any other branch can cause errors, especially if you are working on a different issue.

Also, as a reminder, please follow [Hacktober's Code of Conduct](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details) as well!

If you feel that anything should be added to this, you can also reach out to me at redfireforever103@gmail.com!

## Notes for Developer

When adding a new webpage to my navigation bar, change the max-width property in the template.css file so the navigation bar does not overlap into two rows.
