      <h3>Enlighten.Net</h3>
      <h4>Back-End Software Developer</h4>
      <h4>Time-Frame: June - August 2020</h4>
      <p>
          I had returned during the Summer of 2020 to continue my work with Enlighten.Net. Development was mainly
          done using C# and the .NET framework. We managed our projects using DevOps and the Visual Studio Community 
          IDE. I worked on their ENet Docs application. Here are some of the things that I worked on during the summer!
          <ul>
            <li>
                First, I continued my initial implementation on the main enhancement I worked on last summer, which was
                to add a storage provider which would programatically upload storage items to the Amazon S3 Bucket. I 
                changed the initial provider to include storage items from Enlighten.Net
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, I updated their configuration system to further customize our Amazon S3 storage provider. Using the 
                Windows Registry, I set up the Amazon S3 Bucket Configuration within the customer's configuration, allowing 
                them to use one of Enlighten.Net's four buckets (which were distributed among the four Availability Zones 
                throughout the US) and, if they have one, use one of their own buckets. I also added the configuration in 
                which the user can have a default bucket, or they can specify a bucket to store each type of file (for example
                they can have a default bucket where everything is stored, but can specify a bucket for just their PDF files).
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, I resolved a couple of bugs within their Web API. Specifically, I provided a solution for their 'Save'
                button, which at times was enabled when it should not have been. I also added functionality to a 'Sign and
                Move' button, in which if the user had permission to upload a file, they would automatically give permission
                to save the file (usually, the person would have to sign their request before saving it).
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, I began my implementation for a VerifyBucket tool. This command-line tool, given the company ID, would
                synchronize our database with the data that is stored in each Amazon bucket they have listed and report any
                differences between our database and the data in their Amazon Bucket/s.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning, and Semantics (HEALS) Project</h3>
      <h4>Front-End Software Developer</h4>
      <h4>Time Frame: Feburary - August 2020</h4>
      <p>
        During my second semester, I applied for and was accepted to the HEALS Project as an undergraduate research assistant. While
        I was employed, I primarily worked on the application's graphical user interface using pure HTML/CSS and Javascript/JSON, while 
        collaborating on work using the Node-Red environment. Here are some of the things I worked on during my time.
        <ul>
          <li>
            I was mainly responsible for creating the front-end of the application. I would receive a template design for the website, and
            I would implement the design in HTML/CSS. In total, there were 2 redesigns involved in creating the HEALS front-end application. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Another change that I made was to use data sent from the server (JSON format) and 
          </li>
