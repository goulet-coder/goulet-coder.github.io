        <h4>Employment:</h4>
        <h5>Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning, and Semantics (HEALS) Project</h5>
        <p>Title: Undergraduate Research Assistant</p>
        <p>Role: Front-End Software Engineer</p>
        <p>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and IBM have collaborated together to create the HEALS Project, which aims to
