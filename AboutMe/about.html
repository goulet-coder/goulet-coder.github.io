    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <article>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Hello! I am a current undergraduate student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Troy, NY) studying for my 
        Bachelors in Computer Science major. For now, I am studying on the General Track, although after completing
        Intro to Algorithms, I would like to concentrate on the Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence track. 
        I am also a front-end software developer for the RPI HEALS Project, which seeks to improve the healthcare industry
        by helping patients manage their health conditions, help doctors find abnormalities through the use of statistics, 
        cloud computing, and data representation, and decrease the costs of healthcare. I am a passionate software developer
        who has been programming since the sixth grade, and am determined to write clean, reliable software.

      <h3>Middle School</h3>
      <p>My passion for computer science began in middle school, when I joined the Technology Student Association. I was 
          the new kid in school, and joined the STEM-oriented club to make new friends and explore different hobbies. 
          As an active member of the Technology Student Association, I took part in many STEM-related activities, such as 
          Dragster Design, Website Design, and Video Game Design. I had showed a natural skill in the area of software development
          as well, winning numerous competitions at TSA's Annual Connecticut State Conference, where our projects are judged 
          based on creativity, functionality, and documentation. 
      </p>
      <p>
          My passion for computer science grew as I had the wonderful opportunity to attend TSA's 2015 National Conference in 
          Dallas, Texas. There, I was amazed by the vast amount of technical projects that students from all over the country
          submitted for display. It varied from robotics, software development, hackathons, too many to count! I was truly 
          inspired to be surrounded by thousands of other young students who all had an enjoyment of STEM. I returned from 
          the conference with a newfound appreciation for STEM, and convinced that I wanted to study the field of Computer Science.

      <h3>High School</h3>
      <p>
        I entered high school excited to learn more about computer science! I was fortunate enough to learn at a high school
        with a great amount of computer science courses. Determined to learn as much as I could, I enrolled in every computer
        science course that was taught, including Intro to Computer Science, Exploring Computer Science, AP Computer Science Principles, 
        Game and Web Design, and AP Computer Science A; and aced them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I remained an active member of TSA, continuing my membership to the high school level. I took part in many different competitions
        and designed many different applications. I encouraged my friends to join the club, and volunteered to help with preparing our school
        for the Connecticut State Conference. During my senior year (2018-2019), I was elected to be the Connecticut TSA State Treasurer, where
        I helped organize and manage TSA at the state-level. As a State-Wide role model and leader, I represented Connecticut TSA at the state-level
        capital, regularly met with the other Connecticut TSA State Officers, managed the funds of Connecticut TSA, and prepare for the Annual
        Connecticut State Conference. As the Treasurer, I prioritized increasing awareness of Connecticut TSA (particularly in low-income and 
        minority areas) through merchendice, as well as established our partnership with the American Cancer Society through a bake sale (with
        the help of volunteers from my high school's National Honor Society). 
      </p>
      <p>
        During my senior year of high school, I also helped one of my computer science teachers, Ms. Corricelli, to develop a new computer science
        course that specializes in cryptography and cybersecurity. During the spring semester, I volunteered during my lunch periods to review
        the course material with my teacher, as well as made adjustments to the course when needed. The course, Cryptography and Cybersecurity,
        specializes in the history of cryptography and cybersecurity, learning different ciphers, and learning how to program (in Python) the 
        computer to encrypt and decrypt messages. This course is currently being offered at Conard High School.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also volunteered for various STEM organizations during the 2018-2019 academic year. In the spring semester, I volunteered to teach
        Scratch (block-based programming platform) to elementary school students at Smith Elementary School, as a member of Bits and Bytes, a 
        Computer Science community service club. Additionally, I volunteered to join the National Girl's Collaborative Project's National Advisory
        Board, which advocates for female and non-binary students pursuing a STEM career.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated from Conard High School with a 4.1/4.5 GPA and a member of the Class of 2019. I was accepted and enrolled into 
        Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for a Bachelors in Computer Science, and with AP credit, was able to start a semester ahead.

      <h3>College</h3>
      <p>
        I started college a semester ahead, and did not waste any time to learn computer science. With Computer Science 1 completed in high school,
        I continued my studies through Data Structures, Calculus I & II, Foundations of Computer Science, and Computer Organization throughout 
        my freshman year. Despite the average Fall 2019 Freshman Cumulative GPA of ~2.3, I finished my first semester with a 3.5 Cumulative GPA and made 
        the Dean's Honor List.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a freshman, I joined RPI's Coding && Community club, a STEM-oriented community service club that seeks to aid underrepresented students
        in STEM be exposed to and follow their passions in STEM. During the 2019-2020 academic school year, I volunteered as a Java Instructor at 
        Troy High School, where I helped students create and debug their code. Additionally, in the summer of 2020, I volunteered as an Instructor
        for the STEP Summer 2020 program, which students can learn various aspects of computer science. As an instructor, I created some of the curriculum
        that was taught in the STEP Summer 2020 program, including Cryptography and Cybersecurity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another club that I joined in my freshman year was the American Computing Machinery - Women's Division (ACM-W) at RPI. ACM-W at RPI 
        helps incoming female and non-binary students transition from high school to college, as well as establishes a support group for 
        underrepresented students in Computer Science.

      <h3>The Future</h3>
      <p>After completing my computer science degree, I would like to enter the workforce as a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and develop a specialization
         as I gain new work experience. At the moment, I am still exploring different areas of software development, and I am open
         to trying new things!
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I would like to expand my academic knowledge of computer science and further contribute to software-related research 
        through a Masters in Computer Science.

      <h3>About Me Personally</h3>
      <p>
        Outside of computer science, I am an outdoors enthusiast! In my freetime, I like bicycling, hiking, and running. I am a member of 
        Rensselaer's Outing Club, where we hike up mountains in nearby Vermont and upstate New York. I also played soccer and tennis 
        for my high school, playing at the varsity level for soccer and at the junior-varsity level for tennis. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also a community-oriented person. While my main volunteering efforts are focused on computer science, I also volunteer for 
        many other organizations. I like to especially help children with special needs. I am a three-time volunteer for the iCan Bike 
        program, a week-long summer camp that teaches children with disabilities how to ride bicycles. I am also a two-time volunteer 
        for Autism CONNECTicut's representation at West Hartford's Annual "Celebrate!" festival. I volunteered to run at a tent where
        those with special needs can rest in case they experience sensory overload. In high school, I was an active member of the National
        Honor Society and the National Spanish Honor Society.
      </p>
