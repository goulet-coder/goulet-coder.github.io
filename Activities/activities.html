        <h4>Coding && Community</h4>
        <p>
          Coding && Community is a STEM-themed community service club that seeks to close the gender and race
          disparities in the field of computer science. I first discovered Coding && Community as a freshman during
          the annual Activity Fair. After attending a couple of their general meetings, I applied and accepted
          a volunteering position as a Java Instructor for Troy High School students. During this time, I attended
          their high school computer science class and directly mentored students through the programs that they
          were designing. Not only did this solidify my skills and confidence in Java programming, but it also 
          helped students who were not as fortunate enough to attend a school with a solid curriculum for computer
          science education. I want to help these students have better access to a STEM education, and therefore,
          Coding && Community would like to establish an AP Computer Science A course by the end of 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to being a Java Instructor, I also volunteer as a STEP Instructor for Coding && Community's 
          STEP program. The STEP program teaches computer science principles to middle and high school students 
          in the Troy area. One of my main responsibilities is to develop the brand new curriculum for Cryptography
          and Cybersecurity, and taught the curriculum virtually (due to the COVID-19 pandemic). 
        </p>

        <h4>Association for Computing Machinery - Women's Division (ACM-W)</h4>
        <p>
          The ACM-W division supports female and non-binary students pursuing a 
          degree in Computer Science. Weekly meetings are held in which members can be mentored by Comptuer Science
          professors. ACM-W also runs a mentor program for first-year students majoring in computer science, in which
          we assist them in progressing through their freshman year.

        <h4>National Girls Collaborative Project (NGCP) - National Girls Advisory Board</h4>
        <p>
          The primary goal of the NGCP is to encourage girls to the fields of STEM. As a member of 
          the NGCP Girls Advisory Board, I provide feedback to the projects sponsored by the NGCP. I 
          offer support for projects through volunteering, and as a Collegiate Member, I mentor the 
          younger women on the Advisory Board!

      <h3>High School</h3>
      <article>
        <h4>The Connecticut Technology Student Association (CT-TSA)</h4>
        <p>
          The Technology Student Association is a nation-wide STEM club designed for middle and high
          school students who are interested in STEM. Throughout the academic year, students design 
          various STEM-related projects and submit them for state and nation-wide competitions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          During my involvement in middle school, I remained an active member of the organization. I 
          explored various projects in STEM, such as Dragster Design, Digital Photography, and Web Development. I placed 
          in numerous state-level competitions, including 3rd place in the Technology Bowl 
          (a jeopardy-like competition where teams of three attempt to answer tech-related questions 
          correctly) and 1st Place in Video Game Design (development done in GameMaker). In the eighth 
          grade, I was also elected to serve as the Vice President for my middle school's division.
        </p>
        <p>
          I continued to be an active member as a high school student. Throughout my membership, I experimented
          with multiple aspects of STEM, including Animation Creations and Digital Video Production (placed 2nd), 
          as well as continuing my interests in Software Development and Dragster Design. During the 2018-2019 academic
          year, I served as the State Treasurer for the Connecticut Technology Student Association. During my one-year 
          term, I represented CT-TSA at the State Capital, managed the funds of CT-TSA, prepare and setup everything 
          needed for the State Conference, and organized a bake sale to support the American Cancer Society, a partner
          of CT-TSA.

        <h4>Girls With Impact Program</h4>
        <p>
          The Girls With Impact Program is a 12-week, online course that teaches high school women concepts on how to 
          run a business, demonstrate leadership, and help the community. Throughout the course, I created a business
          plan for <span>The Hidden Workforce</span>, an online application that will help students with disabilities 
          find jobs. 
        </p>

        <h4>Bits && Bytes + WiSTEM</h4>
        <p>
          Bits && Bytes is a community service club. Computer Science students travel weekly
          to a local elementary school to teach students how to program in Scratch. This 
          program ends with a tour of the high school STEM classrooms. During my involvement in the club, I helped students 
          create and fix bugs in their Scratch languages, as well as offered a brief introduction to the Java Programming
          language. 
        </p>
        <p>
          WiSTEM is another community service club. The purpose of WiSTEM is to encourage and
          support women in STEM. Within the club, we give advice to other community members on seeking out resources and advice
          that will help meet their needs and help them reach their goals. During the 2019 academic year, WiSTEM partnered with 
          Tallan to offer a school-wide scholarship that would help a female student interested in computer science by supplying
          them with a laptop and other accessories to help them succeed throughout college.
